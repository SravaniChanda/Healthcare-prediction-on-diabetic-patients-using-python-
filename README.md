# Healthcare-prediction-on-diabetic-patients-using-python
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of diabetes in patients using various machine-learning models implemented in Python.
The dataset comprises several predictor variables including pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin levels, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and age, with the target variable indicating the presence or absence of diabetes.
This project seeks to address the challenge of predicting diabetes risk by employing machine learning algorithms on a dataset containing health parameters. 
The goal is to develop a reliable tool for healthcare professionals to identify individuals at risk of diabetes early on, aiding in timely intervention and management.
Conclusion :
Logistic Regression emerged as the top-performing algorithm with an accuracy of 77.52%, making it a reliable choice for predicting diabetes risk in patients.
However, the Decision Tree classifier yielded lower accuracy at 71.5%, indicating potential limitations in its predictive power for this dataset.
While both KNN and Random Forest demonstrated consistent performances, ranging from 72.46% to 76.85%, the choice of algorithm should consider factors such as interpretability and computational efficiency.
To maximize accuracy and efficiency in predicting diabetes risk, businesses should consider implementing Logistic Regression while also exploring ensemble methods like Random Forest for improved model performance.
